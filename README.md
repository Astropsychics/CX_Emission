# CX Emission

This is a CX emission model for cometary emissions as detected from Chandra. 
The contents of this model are a modified variant of the CX calculations in the CometaryScatter 
program that now include HRC response spectra, extends the CX spectrum down to 100 eV, and 
calculates the chi square values for the model.
